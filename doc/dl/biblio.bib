	abstract={Spatio-temporal, geo-referenced datasets are growing rapidly, and will be more in the near future, due to both technological and social/commercial reasons. From the data mining viewpoint, spatio-temporal trajectory data introduce new dimensions and, correspondingly, novel issues in performing the analysis tasks. In this paper, we consider the clustering problem applied to the trajectory data domain. In particular, we propose an adaptation of a density-based clustering algorithm to trajectory data based on a simple notion of distance between trajectories. Then, a set of experiments on synthesized data is performed in order to test the algorithm and to compare it with other standard clustering approaches. Finally, a new approach to the trajectory clustering problem, called temporal focussing, is sketched, having the aim of exploiting the intrinsic semantics of the temporal dimension to improve the quality of trajectory clustering.},

	abstract = {Existing trajectory clustering algorithms group similar trajectories as a whole, thus discovering common trajectories. Our key observation is that clustering trajectories as a whole could miss common sub-trajectories. Discovering common sub-trajectories is very useful in many applications, especially if we have regions of special interest for analysis. In this paper, we propose a new partition-and-group framework for clustering trajectories, which partitions a trajectory into a set of line segments, and then, groups similar line segments together into a cluster. The primary advantage of this framework is to discover common sub-trajectories from a trajectory database. Based on this partition-and-group framework, we develop a trajectory clustering algorithm TRACLUS. Our algorithm consists of two phases: partitioning and grouping. For the first phase, we present a formal trajectory partitioning algorithm using the minimum description length(MDL) principle. For the second phase, we present a density-based line-segment clustering algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that TRACLUS correctly discovers common sub-trajectories from real trajectory data.},
